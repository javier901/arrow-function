# Arrow Functions

## Learning Goals

- Review declaring a function using a function expression
- Declare a function using arrow syntax
- Describe situations where arrow functions are used

## Introduction

The original style for defining functions in JavaScript is the _function
declaration_. But JavaScript has two other ways to write functions: the
_function expression_ and the _arrow function expression_ (often simply
called an _arrow function_). In this lesson, we will start by briefly
reviewing function expressions, then we will learn how to write functions
using _arrow syntax_.

## Review: Declare a Function Using a Function Expression

The first method we learned for defining a function is the _function
declaration_:

```js
function foo() {
  return 'bar';
}
```

But, as we've learned, a function can also be written as follows:

```js
const foo = function() {
  return 'bar';
}
```

The `function() {...}` to the right of the assignment operator (`=`) is called a
_function expression_. The best way to understand function expressions is by
analogy.

```js
const sum = 1 + 1
```

Evaluate the expression `1 + 1`, returning `2`, and assign it to the variable
`sum`.

```js
const difference = 10 - 1;
```

Evaluate the expression `10 - 1`, returning `9`, and assign it to the variable
`difference`.

```js
const foo = function() {
  return 'bar';
}
```

Evaluate the expression `function() { return 'bar' }`, returning a thing that
can be called, and assign it to the variable `foo`.

We've also learned that the function expression (again, the thing to the right
of `=`) is known as an _anonymous function_. It doesn't have a name associated
with it like you see in a _function declaration_.

However, when we assign an anonymous function to a variable, we have a name that
points to a callable thing. We can call this anonymous function by invoking
`foo()`. That anonymous function is now, for all practical purposes, named
`foo`.

There are a few subtle differences between _function declarations_ and _function
expressions_, but they are very minute. Neither is really better than the other.
Over time, conventions have evolved in the JavaScript programming community for
when to use one vs. the other; you will develop a sense for these as you
continue to learn JavaScript. Ultimately, however, you are free to use whichever
one you prefer.

## Declare a Function Using An Arrow Function

The arrow syntax builds on the syntax of the function expression and provides a
shorthand way to declare functions that doesn't require using the `function`
keyword. In fact, in cases where the function body consists of one line of code,
we can define it in a single line:

```js
const add = (parameter1, parameter2) => parameter1 + parameter2;
add(2,3); //=> 5
```

First, we declare a variable `add` and assign an _anonymous function_ as its
value. Nothing new there. So, let's look to the right of the `=`.

```js
(parameter1, parameter2) => parameter1 + parameter2;
// Parameter list ^^^^^   // Function Body ^^^^^^^^
```

This is a very short function body! It adds `parameter1` and `parameter2`. There
are a couple of things to be aware of in the code above: first, note that if the
function body consists of a single expression, we no longer need to wrap it in
curly braces. Second, **when there are no braces, arrow functions have an
_implicit_ return**, i.e., they _automatically_ return the result of the last
expression! **This is the only situation in which a JavaScript function doesn't
require _explicit return_ with the `return` keyword.**

To the left of the `=>`, you see the parameters that are defined for the
function. This looks similar to what we would have done with a function
declaration: list the parameters, separated by commas, inside of `()`.

If your arrow function has only one parameter, the `()` around the parameter
becomes optional:

```js
const twoAdder = x => x + 2;
// is the same as
const twoAdder = (x) => x + 2;
```

Almost all developers will drop the parentheses in this case.

If we need to do more work than return a single expression, we'll need `{}` to
wrap the multiple lines of code, **and** we'll have to declare a `return`. That
sweet no-`return` syntax is only available if your function body is one
expression long.

```js
const sum = (parameter1, parameter2) => {
  console.log(`Adding ${parameter1}`);
  console.log(`Adding ${parameter2}`);
  return parameter1 + parameter2;
}
sum(1,2); //=> 3
```

## Describe Situations Where Arrow Functions Are Used

Arrow functions are often used in JavaScript's _iterator_ methods. An iterator
is a method that allows you to deal with a set of data one at a time. For
example, if you had a group of students' essays, you could only grade them one
at a time.

In addition to looping constructs such as `for`, JavaScript includes a number of
_advanced iterators_; we'll learn about these later in this section. For now, to
see an example of how arrow functions are used in these methods, we'll preview
JavaScript's `.map()` method.

The `.map()` method is called on an `Array` and takes a function as an argument.
It iterates through the array, passing each element in turn to the function. It
then takes that function's return value and adds it to a new array, leaving the
original array unchanged. That new array, containing the modified elements, is
returned at the end after all iterations are complete.

```js
const nums = [1,2,3];
const squares = nums.map(x => x ** 2); 
squares; //=> [1,4,9]
nums; //=> [1,2,3]
```

Note that the argument being passed to `map` above is an arrow function! In each
iteration through the `nums` array, `map` passes the value of the current
element to the arrow function as an argument and it is assigned to the parameter
`x`. That value is then squared and stored in a new array. After `map` has
iterated through all of the elements, it returns the new array containing the
squared values.

If all this math stuff seems a bit too textbook-y, be reassured that we can
iterate through anything, not just numbers. In the following example, we can
imagine that `overdueTodoItems` is a collection of DOM elements:

```js
finishedItems = overdueTodoItems.map( item => item.className = "complete" );
header.innerText = `You finished ${finishedItems.length} items!`;
```

Or we might use `map` in billing software:

```js
lapsedUserAccounts.map( u => sendBillTo(u.address) );
```

Don't worry if you don't completely follow everything that goes on here — we
will cover advanced iterators in detail later in this section.

## Instructions

You are going to write several methods. Write your code in the `index.js` file.
Let the tests guide you through the process.

## Conclusion

In this lesson you saw two different styles for declaring functions: function
expressions and arrow functions. Neither is "better" than the standard function
declaration we've been using. Arrow functions excel when a simple change or
operation needs to be used repeatedly. But they're certainly used to write long,
complex functions too! As you continue through the course, you'll see all three
methods used to write functions, and develop a feel for when to use each.
